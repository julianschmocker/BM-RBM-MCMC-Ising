# BM-RBM-MCMC-Ising
Contains implementations of MCMC methods for the fully connected Ising Model (Curie-Weiss). Then, we also run numerical simulations for fully visible Boltzmann Machine, for Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM and Bernoulli-Gaussian RBM. For this the Contrastive Divergence and the persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm were implemented for BM and RBM.
